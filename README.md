# Addressing Deep Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Empirical Algorithm Performance Evaluation

This repository contains the code used to generate all plots in my dissertation on multi-agent RL evaluation methodologies. The dissertation is accompanied by a [publication](https://sites.google.com/view/marl-standard-protocol/) with Instadeep Ltd. titled:

**Towards a Standardised Performance Evaluation Protocol for Cooperative MARL**

R. Gorsane, O. Mahjoub, R. J. de Kock, R. Dubb, S. Singh, and A. Pretorius, “Towards a Standardised Performance Evaluation Protocol for Cooperative MARL,” in Thirty-Sixth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022. [Online]. Available: https://openreview.net/forum?id=am86qcwErJm

## Contents of the Repo:

1. A Google Colab Jupyter [notebook](EDA_MARL_Evaluation_Literature.ipynb) for analysis of a [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XZXIEQU1zgq8nhROVukWnriCBRdUMtdO/view?usp=sharing) on deep cooperative MARL literature. Plots contained in section 2.3 of this dissertation are generated using this notebook.

2. A Google Colab [notebook]() for drawing the two plots of example preferential value functions found in subsetion 2.4 on multi-criteria decision analysis.
